										Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to have the pleasure of Designing and Programming Websites for the
										last handful of years.
										I first worked as a Graphic Designer at a Printing Facility, designing everything from
										Business Cards and Logos to flyers, brochures, and huge banners.
										Eventually I was asked to make a website - and I did what every programmer does: I do
										searches using Google to figure out how to fix my problems and errors. Since then, I have
										been learning the ins and outs of the Web Design world - specifically Front End
										Development.
										In Web Design I satiate my desire to visually design something while stretching my
										Programming wings at the same time. I like to work with the Wordpress platform, focusing
										on creating websites that result in a pleasing browsing experience for the user - making
										sure that the website is viewable on whatever sized screen, fast, and beautiful.
										Outside of work, I enjoy growing Carnivorous Plants and learning how to make stuff with
										wood.My Skills: Print / Graphic Design, 5 Years Experience, adobe Photoshop / Illustrator,
										Knowledge of Design Principles
										Experience working at a Print Facility, Web Design & Development class, 8 Years Experience
										HTML, CSS/SCSS/SASS , Javascript, JQuery, PHP, Wordpress Expert,Bootstrap,
										Responsive/Mobile Design
										Performance Optimization, 1 year working with React</p>
